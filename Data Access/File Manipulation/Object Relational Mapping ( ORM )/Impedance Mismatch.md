**Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch** refers to the difficulties that arise when integrating object-oriented programming languages (like Java) with relational databases. The fundamental differences between the paradigms of OOP and relational databases create challenges in mapping objects to database tables and vice versa.

#### **Key Differences:**
- **Data Representation:**
    - **OOP:** Data is represented as objects with attributes and behaviors.
    - **Relational Databases:** Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- **Relationships:**
    - **OOP:** Relationships are navigated through object references.
    - **Relational Databases:** Relationships are managed through foreign keys and join operations.
- **Inheritance:**
    - **OOP:** Supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit properties and methods from parent classes.
    - **Relational Databases:** Lack native support for inheritance, making it difficult to represent class hierarchies.
### Common Challenges
1. **Mapping Classes to Tables:**
    - Deciding how to represent class hierarchies and relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many) in database tables.
2. **Handling Null Values:**
    - Objects can have `null` fields, while databases require careful handling of `NULL` values to maintain data integrity.
3. **Data Types Mismatch:**
    - Java data types may not have direct equivalents in SQL, necessitating type conversions.
4. **Identity and Equality:**
    - Objects are compared by reference, whereas database records are compared by primary keys.
5. **Lazy vs. Eager Loading:**
    - Deciding when to load related data can impact performance and memory usage.
6. **Transaction Management:**
    - Ensuring data consistency and integrity across multiple operations.
