covered comprehensive aspects of **CSV Handling in Java**, structured into three main sections:

1. **Understanding CSV Basics:**
    - Learned CSV structure, syntax rules, limitations, and use cases.
    - Created well-formed CSV documents with considerations for special characters and quoting.
2. **Reading and Writing CSV Files in Java:**
    - **Manual Parsing:** Implemented basic CSV reading and writing using `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter`, understanding their limitations.
    - **Using Libraries for CSV Handling:**
        - **Apache Commons CSV:** Read and write CSV files with flexible configurations and robust handling of complexities.
        - **OpenCSV:** Utilized bean binding and annotations for easy mapping between CSV data and Java objects.
        - **SuperCSV:** Employed advanced features like cell processors for data validation and transformation.
3. **Advanced Topics in CSV Handling:**
    - **CSV Data Mapping to Objects:** Mapped CSV rows to Java POJOs using libraries, handling nested data structures.
    - **Error Handling in CSV Processing:** Managed malformed records, data type mismatches, and logged errors effectively.
    - **Optimizing CSV Reading for Large Files:** Implemented strategies like chunk processing, streaming, parallel processing, and memory-mapped files to handle large datasets efficiently.
