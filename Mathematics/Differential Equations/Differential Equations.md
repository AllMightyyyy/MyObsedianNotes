# Differential Equations

In differential equations, exponential functions arise naturally due to their nature of self-replicating under differentiation, which means their rate of change is proportional to the function itself.

Let's consider a simple linear differential equation with constant coefficients:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky
$$
where \( y(t) \) is the function of time, and \( k \) is a constant. The solution to this equation is:
$$
y(t) = Ce^{kt}
$$
where \( C \) is a constant determined by initial conditions. The solution can be verified like this:
$$
\frac{dy(t)}{dt} = \frac{d(Ce^{kt})}{dt} = ky(t)
$$

#### **Difference Equations: Analogous Exponential Behavior**
Difference equations, like differential equations, often involve linear relationships with constant coefficients, but in a discrete rather than continuous setting. Consider a simple linear homogeneous recurrence relation:
$$
x_{n} = a x_{n-1}
$$
To see why 
$$
x_n = r^n 
$$
might be a solution, substitute it into the recurrence relation:
$$
r^n = a r^{n-1}
$$
Dividing both sides by \( r^{n-1} \) (assuming \( r \) is not null) gives us: \( r = a \).

This shows that 
$$
x_n = r^n 
$$
is indeed a solution when \( r = a \). More generally, for a second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation like:
$$
x_n = b x_{n-1} + c x_{n-2}
$$
assume \( x_n = r^n \) and substitute:
$$
r^n = b r^{n-1} + c r^{n-2}
$$
Dividing both sides by \( r^{n-2} \) (assuming \( r \) is not null) gives us:
$$
r^2 = b r + c
$$
Thus, by finding the roots \( r \) of this equation, we would also be solving the recurrence.
